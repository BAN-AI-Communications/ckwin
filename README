To build the console version of C-Kermit for Windows you will need:
  * Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or 7.0  (2002)
    - 7.1 (2003), 8.0 (2005) and 9.0 (2008) *might* work but this is 
	  currently untested.
	- 10.0 (2010) does not work. Newer versions probably don't either.
  * While Kerberos support is all disabled some header files are still
    referenced. Kerberos for Windows v2.2-beta2 must still be present under
	/kerberos/kfw-2.2-beta-2.
  * SSL support is also currently disabled but still has header files
    being referenced. OpenSSL v0.9.7 needs to live under /openssl/0.9.7. You 
	might have to build it for the header files to all end up in the right 
	place.

Once everything is in place, edit /setenv.bat to point to your source
directory, CD into /kermit/k95 then run:
  nmake /nologo /e /f ckoker.mak msvc
This will build the console version (cknker.exe) and a few other binaries.

Future stuff to do:
  * Get the GUI version (k95g.exe) building	
  * Port to a compiler from this decade
  * Strip out all licensing code
  * Remove all Kermit 95 branding
  * Restore use of fsetpos in ckofio.c (see line 5412)
  * Turn long long support back on (remove -DNOLONGLONG in makefile)
  * Re-enable/rewrite features that were disabled to get it building such as:
    - SSH
	- Kerberos
	- zlib
	- OpenSSL
	- SRP
	- Z/Y/Z Modem
    This will require upgrading to current versions of the libraries.
