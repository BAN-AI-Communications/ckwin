This is C-Kermit for Windows. For more information on Kermit, visit the
Kermit Project website: http://www.kermitproject.org.

Currently the following features are disabled due to their use of obsolete
or proprietary libraries:
  - SSH
  - Kerberos
  - SRP
  - OpenSSL
  - X, Y and Z Modem
  - DECnet
  - LAT

To build C-Kermit for Windows you will need:
  * Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or 7.0  (2002)
    - 7.1 (2003), 8.0 (2005) and 9.0 (2008) *might* work but this is 
      currently untested.
    - 10.0 (2010) does not work. Newer versions probably don't either.
  * While Kerberos support is all disabled some header files are still
    referenced. Kerberos for Windows v2.2-beta2 must still be present under
    /kerberos/kfw-2.2-beta-2.

Once everything is in place, edit /setenv.bat to point to your source
directory. Then:
 1. Open up a console window
 2. Setup the Visual C++ environment. For Visual C++ 6.0 this will probably be:
       C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin\VCVARS32.bat
    For Visual C++ 7.0 (Visual Studio .net 2002) the default is:
       C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat
 3. CD into your source directory and run the following:
      setenv.bat
      cd kermit/k95
      mknt.bat
      mkg.bat
This should leave you with a bunch of binaries in your current directory, the
most interesting being:
  cknker.exe   - Console version of C-Kermit for Windows
  k95g.exe     - Graphical version of C-Kermit for Windows

Future stuff to do:
  * Port to a compiler from this decade
  * Strip out all licensing code
  * Remove all Kermit 95 branding
  * Restore use of fsetpos in ckofio.c (see line 5412)
  * Turn long long support back on (remove -DNOLONGLONG in makefile)
  * Re-enable/rewrite features that were disabled to get it building such as:
    - SSH
    - Kerberos
    - zlib
    - OpenSSL
    - SRP
    - Z/Y/Z Modem
    This will require upgrading to current versions of the libraries.
