The C-Kermit Registration Tool (K95REGTL) is a GUI utility distributed
for Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 9x with C-Kermit to:

 1. Associate C-Kermit with Kermit Script (.KSC) files in the Windows
    Registry.

 2. Create shortcuts for C-Kermit and/or the Dialer on your desktop.

 3. Create entries for C-Kermit and/or the Dialer in the Start Menu.

REGISTRY

The Registry functions are on the first page of the K95REGTL screen.  It
allows you to associate your copy K95G.EXE with any file whose name ends in
".KSC"; thus double-clicking on such a file launches C-Kermit, telling it to
execute the commands that are in it.

You can also register C-Kermit as the default Telnet application for your Web
Browser.  This should work with any browser.

You can also use this page to remove all references to C-Kermit from the
Registry.

DESKTOP TOOLS

On this page we find buttons to create desktop shortcuts to K95.EXE and
K95DIAL.EXE.

You can drag these shortcuts to any location you want.  You can destroy them
by dragging them to the trash / recycle bin / shredder.

STARTUP MENU

This page allows you to add entries to your Startup menu for K95G, the Dialer,
and various online documentation files.
